This exercise sheet helps you getting started with compiling you
java source files and running the java virtual machine on your
classes. The steps in the sheet follow Lecture 2.

Throughout I assume you are working in a subdirectory called
@exercise-1@, which is rooted in your home directory. Also I
assume you execute all programs from the command line.

 1) Create a stub file called @Note.java@ and save it.
    The class should contain the following definitions:

    public class Note {
    }

  2) Create a file called @Main.java@, which contains the
     following lines:

    public class Main {
        public static void main( final String[] args ) {
            final Note note = new Note( );
            System.out.println( note );
        }
    }

  3) Save the file and compile your java sources. Depending on
     your javac compiler this may require compiling each individual
     source file:

     $ javac Note.java
     $ javac Main.java

     You may have to fix errors...

  4) You should now hav two class files: one for the @Note@ class and
     one for the @Main@ class. Run your main class with the @java@
     virtual machine:

     $ ls *.class
     Main.class    Note.class
     $ java Main
     # output omitted.

  5) Override the @toString@ method as follows. For the moment we
     return a canned string. In a few moments we shall let the method
     proper instance state.

     @Override
     public String toString( ) {
         return "default note text";
     }

  6) Save your @Note@ class. Compile your classes with @javac@ and run
     the java JVM on the main class.

     $ javac Note.java
     $ javac Main.java
     $ java Main
     default note text

  7) Change the line which constructs the @Note@ instance in the @Main@
     class to the following; save your class.

            final Note note = new Note( "hello world!" );

  8) Insert a definition for a @String@ attribute @note@ in the @Note@
     class, insert the following definition for the @Note@ constructor,
     in the @Note@ class; save the class.

     private final string note;

     public Note( final String text ) {
         note = text;
     }


  9) Save your @Note@ class. Compile your classes with @javac@ and run
     the java JVM on the main class.

     $ javac Note.java
     $ javac Main.java
     $ java Main
     default note text

 10) The @note@ instance should now have the proper instance state but
     we need to let the method @toString@ return the state. You can do
     this by changing the @return@ statement in the method to the
     following:

         return note;

 11) Save your @Note@ class. Compile your classes with @javac@ and run
     the java JVM on the main class.

     $ javac Note.java
     $ javac Main.java
     $ java Main
     hello world!

 12) Congratulations. You've dunnit! Make some more changes to the file,
     compile the java sources and run the JVM on the main class. I
     suggest you re-implement the @Note@ and @Main@ classes from
     Lecture 2.
